# Polisemantic Class {#polisemantic}

**Context** 

Job advertisements are typically written in a formal register, where many terms exhibit polysemy—that is, they carry multiple senses, some of which may imply bias in other contexts while remaining neutral here. Because lexicon-based detectors lack the contextual awareness to distinguish these senses, they often overlook words that are harmless in a job ad but problematic elsewhere.


**Definition** 

We define the [**Polisemantic**]{style="color: #a9a9a9;"} class as all words that function neutrally within a job advertisement yet could convey bias in a different setting. Annotators must flag every instance of such polysemous vocabulary—regardless of lexicon matches—and confirm its unbiased usage in context.
